## Objective
This exercise aims to:
1. Test your engineering skills ;
2. Give you the opportunity to play with our stack and a part of our payloads.
3. Serve as a basis for discussion for the technical interview.

Below you will find the instructions of this exercise.

## Before beginning
Keep in mind that:
- You do not have to find the right solution, we are interested in the way you'll conceive your program.
- You can use the framework/library you want (At Frichti, we use React).
- You can use third-party libraries as long as the usage is justified.
- If you don't have time to finish all the user stories, you could describe the way you'd do them.

## Coding test
You role as a frontend developer for Frichti consists in developing features and products that helps our customer to order the best dishes !

### User stories
1. As a user I need to see a list Frichti's products from the menu that has `slug` defined to `plats-cuisines-group`.
2. As a user I need to see the products splited according to their categories.
3. As a user I need to see tags associated to each product. (tip: use the tags payload)
4. As a user I need to filter products according to their name (textual research).
5. As a user I need to have a responsive/adaptive interface that is usable in web-mobile.

## Technical test assessment
### Quality over quantity
We like clean and quality code which is reliable. So, we prefer you to do less user stories (by choosing ones you think are the most importants) than doing them all with poor code quality.

### Simple and scalable
The important thing with the exercise is to make things simple and scalable. At Frichti, we like to make the complex things the most simplier and understadable possible.
